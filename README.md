# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ricsi, and my journey through tech has been an exciting adventure. I started out as a **.NET developer** 10 years ago, building solid, efficient applications (and yes, .NET still holds a special place in my heart). As technology evolved, so did my curiosity, leading me to dive into the fast-paced world of **AI**.

Over the years, I expanded my expertise to include **frameworks for building SaaS products** and advanced **automation tools**. Iâ€™ve held the role of **Lead Developer at an international ticketing company**, where I led impactful projects and mentored talented teams. Today, Iâ€™m a **part-time AI consultant**, helping a local company enhance its AI capabilities and working as a product builder striving to bring innovative ideas to market.

The tech community has given me so much over the years, and I believe in giving back by sharing my experiences and insights through **[Medium](https://medium.com/@richard.gyiko) blog posts**. Itâ€™s my way of contributing to the field that fuels my passion.

Outside of coding, Iâ€™m a dedicated parent and an aspiring **regenerative gardener**, finding the balance between tech and personal growth.
